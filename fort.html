    <p>History

        Inside the fort
        Main article: Janjira State
        During its heyday, the island fort boasted 572 cannons.[11]
        
        Visitors can gain access to the Janjira fort from Rajapuri, a small village on the coast. After a short ride in a small boat, one can enter the fort through the main entrance. The fort is oval shaped instead of the usual oblong or square shape. The fort wall is about 40 feet high and has 19 rounded porches or arches, some of which still have cannons mounted on them, including the famous cannon Kalaal Baangadi. These cannons were largely responsible for repelling oncoming enemies from the sea. Inside the fort walls are the ruins of a mosque, a palace and bath with water channeled from streams, evidence that royal ladies occupied the quarters. A deep well, still functional, provides fresh water despite the fort being surrounded by salt water.
        
        On shore is a luxurious cliff-top mansion, the Palace of the Nawab. Built by the former Nawab of Janjira, it commands a panoramic view of the Arabian sea and the Janjira sea fort.[citation needed]
        
        According to another record,[vague] the Abyssinian Sidis established the Janjira and Jafarabad state in early 1100.[12]

        According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral Fernão Mendes Pinto, the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in Aceh prior to the Ottoman expedition to Aceh led by Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis included 200 Malabar sailors from Janjira to aid the region of Batak and Maritime Southeast Asia in 1539.[13] Later, in 1621, the Siddis of Janjira became exceptionally powerful as autonomous state to the point that the commander of Janjira, Siddi Ambar the Little, successfully defied his overlord Malik Ambar's attempt to replace him. Siddi Ambar the Little is accordingly considered the first Nawab of Janjira state.[14]
        
        The island fortress was under control of Adil Shahi dynasty until the reign of Ibrahim II where Janjira fort was lost to the Siddis.[15]
        
        Major historical figures from Murud-Janjira include men such as Sidi Hilal, Yahya Saleh and Sidi Yaqub. During the rule of Sultan Aurangzeb, Sidi Yaqut received a subsidy of 400,000 rupees. He also owned large ships which weighed 300–400 tons. According to the record these ships were unsuitable for fighting on the open sea against European warships, but their size allowed for transporting soldiers for amphibious operations.[16]
        
        Despite their repeated attempts, the Portuguese, the British and the Marathas failed to subdue the power of the Siddis, who were themselves allied with the Mughal Empire. For example, 10,000 soldiers from Moro Pandit were repulsed by Janjira's army in 1676.[17] The Marathas led by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj attempted to scale the 12-meter-high (39 ft) granite walls; he failed in all his attempts. His son Chhatrapati Sambhaji maharaj even attempted to tunnel his way into the fort but was unsuccessful in all his attempts.[18] He built another sea fort in 1676, known as Padmadurg or Kasa fort, to challenge Janjira. It is located northeast of Janjira. Padmadurg took 22 years to build and is constructed on 22 acres of land.

        In the year 1736, Siddis of Murud-Janjira set out in a battle with the forces of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao. On 19 April 1736, Maratha warrior Nanaji Surve and Chimaji Appa attacked the gathering forces in the encampments of the Siddis near Rewas.[19] When the confrontation ended, 1,500 Siddis, including their leader Siddi Sat, were killed. Peace was concluded in September 1736, but the Siddis were confined to only Janjira, Gowalkot, and Anjanwel, thus their power greatly reduced. However, Janjira remained unconquered until it became part of Indian territory after independence from the British in 1947.</p>
    <h2>Daulatabad Fort</h2>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5a/32/f6/5a32f6de49d4fe504a5443c77dd19fac.jpg">
    <p>Daulatabad Fort, also known as Devagiri or Deogiri, is a historic fortified citadel located in Devagiri village near [AURANGABAD, Maharashtra]], India. It was the capital of the Yadava dynasty (9th century–14th century CE), for a brief time the capital of the Delhi Sultanate (1327–1334), and later a secondary capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate (1499–1636).[1][2][3][4][5]

        Around the 6th century CE, Devagiri emerged as an important uplands town near present-day Sambhaji Nagar, along caravan routes going towards western and southern India.[6][7][8][9] The historical triangular fortress in the city was initially built around 1187 by the first Yadava king, Bhillama V.[10] In 1308, the city was annexed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, which ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent. In 1327, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate renamed the city from Devagiri to Daulatabad and shifted his imperial capital to the city from Delhi, ordering a mass migration of Delhi's population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted back to Delhi.[11]
        
        In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, who used it as their secondary capital. In 1610, near Daulatabad Fort, the new city of Aurangabad, then named Khadki, was established to serve as the capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the Ethiopian military leader Malik Ambar, who was brought to India as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Most of the present-day fortifications at Daulatabad Fort were constructed under the Ahmadnagar Sultanate</p>
    <h2>Mehrangarh fort</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jodhpur1.jpg">
    <p>Located in the beautiful blue city of Jodhpur, the Mehrangarh fort is arguably the finest fort in India. It is one of the largest forts in Rajasthan and is known all across the globe for its stunning architecture and history. It is famous for being the seat of the Rathore rulers from the house of Marwar. The fort is located 400 feet above Jodhpur city and housed the Marwar family before they moved to other grand palaces. It once also offered sanctuary to Mughal emperor Humayun who was fleeing to Persia after being defeated by Sher Shah Suri.

        It was on May 12, 1459 that the 15th Rathore ruler, Rao Jodha laid the foundation of the Mehrangarh fort. At that time, Mandore which is located around 15 km from Jodhpur was the capital. However, for better safety and security reasons, Rao Jodha moved the capital to the Mehrangarh fort. The hill on which Mehrangarh stands was formerly known as ‘Bhaurcheeria’. It had just one human accoupant, a hermit named Cheeria Nathji. Rao Jodha displaced him in order to set up his capital at Mehrangarh. Upset and infuriated with the displacement, Nathji cursed Rao Jodha that the Mehrangarh fort would suffer scarcity of water. Then, in order to circumvent this curse, a man named Rajiya Bambi was buried alive in the foundations of the fort. In return for this sacrifice, Rao Jodha primised Bambi that his family will be well looked after. To this day, Rajiya Bambi’s descendants live in Raj Bagh. According to another legend, Rajiya was not the only one buried alive. Four people were buried here including Rajiya Bambi’s son and a Brahmin named Mehran. The fort is believed to have been named after this Brahmin.
        
        The fort’s architecture is a marvel in itself. It is 125 ft high and has solid stone walls. At places, these walls are 6 metres thick. There are several palaces inside the fort’s boundaries. The intricate carvings and expansive courtyards in these palaces remind you of the glory of the Rathore era. There is a downward winding road which leads into the city. You can still see some cannonball imprints on the second gate which were made by the attacking armies of Jaipur. Right next to the fort on its left is the chhatri of Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier who fell defending the fort.
        
        Mehrangarh has seven gates, most popular among which is Jayapol (meaning ‘victory’) which was built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the armies of Jaipur and Bikaner. Another gate named Fattehpol was built by Maharaja Ajit Singh to mark the defeat of the Mughals.
        
        Today, the fort houses a museum which gives visitors a sneak peek into the golden age of the Rathores. It showcases various collections of historical artefacts ranging from palanquins to cannons and furniture to paintings and folk musical instruments. In this museum, you can witness the heritage of the Rathores in arms, paintings, costumes, and decorated period rooms. The gallery named Daulat Khana houses one of the finest collections of Mughal miniature paintings. The Mehrangarh fort is also the venue for the highly acclaimed and popular Rajasthan International Folk Festival and World Sufi Spirit Festival. There is also an excellent zip-lining tour here organized by Flying Fox. Across 6 zip lines, you can go around the fort with stunning views of the blue city.
        
        Timings: The Mehrangarh fort is open on all days between 9 am and 5 pm. The best time to visit Jodhpur is in the winter months of November to February.
        
        Entry fee: Rs. 60 for Indians and Rs 400 for foreigners. On May 12, the fort’s foundation day, entry is free.
        
        How to reach: Mehrangarh fort is located in the city of Jodhpur. It is around 9 km away from the Jodhpur airport and around 6 km away from the Jodhpur Railway station.
        
        Where to stay: Jodhpur is a major tourist attraction in Rajasthan and therefore has several accommodations options ranging from luxury to budget. Castle view homestay provides a great view of the Mehrangarh fort and is worth a try. Hotel RAAS is another good hotel for a comfortable stay with a great view.</p>
    <h2>Chittorgarh fort</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chittorgarh1.jpg">
    <p>The largest fort in India and Asia, Chittorgarh fort is located on a 180-m hill. It expands across 700 acres and is one of the largest forts in Rajasthan. The fort was constructed by the Mauryas in 7th century AD. The Chittorgarh fort is also called as the “water fort” as it has 22 water bodies in addition to towers, palaces and temples. It houses two commemoration towers namely Kirti Stambh and Vijay Stambh. Kirti Stambh was built to honour the first Jain Tirthankar. Vijay Stambh was built to commemorate the victory over Mohammed Alauddin Khilji. The fort of Chittor has a glorious past with three siege attempts, and the act of jauhar committed all three times by women and children.  The first one was led by Rani Padmini, and later by Rani Karnavati. The famous war against Allaudin Khalji in 1303 AD made legends out of war heroes Gora and Badal.

        The fort is home to the Fateh Prakash Palace which houses the government museum. Chittorgarh is associated with two historic figures in India – spiritual poet Meera Bai and Rajput warrior Maharana Pratap. Chittorgarh was the Rajput bastion during a time when almost all other major houses had given in to invasion. As such, it holds a very special place for Rajputs across India. Chittorgarh also has an ancient legend associated with Bhima,  one of the legendary Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata. It is believed that Bhima visited Chittorgarh and became the dsciple of a saint to learn the secrets of immortality. However, he grew impatient while performing the numerous rites and out of sheer anger, stamped on the ground creating a water reservoir. This reservoir came to be called as Bhimtal.</p>

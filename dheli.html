    <h1>DELHI NCR TOURISM</h1>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Delhi-Safdarjung-tomb.jpg">
    <p>Delhi National Capital Region or NCR includes New Delhi and the urban areas surrounding it in neighboring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Delhi NCR is India’s largest agglomeration (or town area) and one of the world’s largest with a population of over 47,000,000 according to the 2011 Census. It contributes 7.5 per cent to India’s GDP.<br>
        A seat of power for centuries, Delhi has seen numerous upheavals and has been destroyed and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Like every major Indian city, Delhi too straddles two worlds: the old constantly attempting to come to terms with the new. Old Delhi, once the capital of Mughal India, is a labyrinth of narrow lanes lined with crumbling havelis and formidable mosques. In contrast, the imperial city of New Delhi build by the British comprises spacious, tree-lined avenues and imposing government buildings.</p>
        <h2>The Red Fort
        </h2>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-delhi-red-fort.jpg">
        <p>The beautiful Red Fort (Lal Qila) was built by Shah Jahan in 1648 and served as the seat of Mughal power until 1857. This stunning structure, with its tall, red sandstone walls covers an area of more than two square kilometers, the entirety of which is crescent shaped and surrounded by a moat.

            The impressive main entrance, the Lahore Gate, is so named as it faces towards Lahore in Pakistan, while the even grander Delhi Gate was used by the emperor for ceremonial processions. Entering through the Lahore Gate, visitors reach Chhatta Chowk, a 17th-century covered bazaar where items such as silks, jewelry, gems, and silverware can be purchased, along with souvenirs and food items.
            
            The Naubat Khana within the Red Fort once housed the musicians who played for the emperor, and its fine galleries still contain many interesting musical instruments such as kettledrums, gongs, and cymbals. Diwan-i-Am, the Hall of Public Audiences, where the emperor would receive his subjects, is also worth seeing for its stunning white marble.
            
            A great way to see the Red Fort and other popular Delhi attractions is by booking a private full-day tour of Old and New Delhi. Highlights of this nine-hour urban adventure include a personal professional guide and driver who'll take you to such points of interest as Humayun's Tomb, Qutub Minar, as well as Jama Masjid, India Gate, and the famous Lotus Temple. Included with your tour are hotel pickup and a ride in a rickshaw.</p>
        <h2>Qutub Minar</h2>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-delhi-qutub-minar.jpg">
        <p>Completed in the 12th century, the beautiful Qutub Minar is India's tallest minaret. It's also now a UNESCO Word Heritage Site that attracts many international visitors eager to climb to the top for its breathtaking views of the surrounding area.

            This ornate five-story tower rises more than 70 meters and is covered with intricate carvings featuring the history of Qutub along with inscriptions from the Koran. It's also notable for being constructed of a number of different types of stone (the first three stories are made of red sandstone, while the fourth and fifth stories were built with marble and sandstone).
            
            The complex also includes the Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid, a mosque at the base of the tower; a gateway built in 1310; and the tombs of Altamish, Alauddin Khalji, and Imam Zamin. Also worth seeing is the 2,000-year-old Iron Pillar, the Alai Minar.

        <h2>India Gate</h2>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-delhi-india-gate.jpg">
        <p>Looking a little like the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the equally impressive India Gate is a magnificent stone arch built as a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in WWI. An eternal flame burns beneath the massive structure, and its walls are inscribed with the names of more than 90,000 soldiers who died in the conflict.

            Standing on a base of red stone and featuring a shallow domed bowl on top that is occasionally filled with burning oil (usually only on important anniversaries), the structure dominates the parkland around it, an always busy area with crowds of tourists and locals alike enjoying a picnic or simply relaxing.
            
            For a real treat, try to see the India Gate at night, considered one of the top free things to do in New Delhi. It's a spectacular sight when it and nearby fountains are floodlit.

        <h2> Akshardham</h2>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-delhi-akshardham.jpg">
        <p>Although only recently completed (it opened in 2007), the splendid Hindu Akshardham temple looks like it could be centuries old. Festooned with intricate and elaborate carvings, this magnificent building attracts countless visitors for its majestic beauty.

            Highlights include the stunning 43-meter-high main monument with its rich carvings of animals, plants, gods, dancers, and musicians, all made from pink sandstone and marble. Of particular note are the 234 ornate pillars supporting its nine domes, as well as a stunning stone tribute to elephants, the centerpiece of which is a massive 3,000-ton statue of one of these beasts.
            
            Other features of interest include a theater showing a movie tracing the building's construction, a fun 15-minute boat ride depicting India's rich history and diverse culture, and the spectacular Yagnapurush Kund, a large musical fountain that is a particular treat when lit up at night.

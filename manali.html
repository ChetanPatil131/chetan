<p>Also known by the names Hidimba Devi Temple and Dhungari Temple, this ancient shrine was built by Maharaja Bahadur Singh way back in 1553. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to Hidimba Devi, wife of Bheema. The wooden architecture of the shrine is very distinct from most Hindu temples you will come across in the country. There’s another shrine dedicated to Hidimba Devi’ son Ghatotkacha in the premises. Surrounded by thick cedar groves and with snow-capped mountains serving as the backdrop, the temple is one of the best places to visit in Manali.

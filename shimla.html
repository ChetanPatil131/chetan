    <h1>SHIMLA TOURISM</h1>
    <h2>The Ridge, Shimla</h2>
    <img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1000x650-320.jpg">
    <p>The Ridge may well be defined as the heart of Shimla in terms of location and tourist attractions. This Shimla tourist spot is actually a wide-open street that runs along the Mall Road from east to west and connects it to the famous Scandal Point. What makes it such a popular destination is that it offers gorgeous views of the snow-capped mountain ranges that rise against the blue sky to border this paradise of a destination. The place is dotted with long-standing British establishments that beckon visitors to indulge in feel-good shopping and binge-eating. Lined with boutiques, bars, restaurants, cafes, and shops, the Ridge serves as the social hub in the region. Remember, this place is among the most photographed parts of the city, thanks to its rich natural beauty and the Gothic structures that define its exquisiteness</p>
    <h2>Jakhoo Hill and Temple, Shimla</h2>

    <p>Covered in a blanket of alpine trees, Jakhoo Hill is the highest point of Shimla and offers scenic views of the snow-covered Shivalik Ranges as well as the sister town of Sanjauli. Situated at a height of 8000 ft. above the sea level, Jakhoo Hill is the location of an ancient Hanuman temple that boasts of having the world’s tallest statue (108 ft.) of this Hindu deity. Shrouded in legends and mysteries, it attracts devotees and the tourists alike. If the local legends are to be believed, the temple stands at the very spot where Lord Hanuman had rested for a while during his journey to bring the Sanjeevani Booti for Lakshman’s revival during the war of Lanka.   </p>
    <h2> Kalka-Shimla Railwa, Shimla</h2>
    <img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1000x650-323.jpg">
    <p>The Kalka-Shimla train ride is a highpoint of Shimla tourism and for a good reason. Built in 1898, this narrow-gauge railway has recently been added to the mountain railways of India World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Winding through the extremely scenic and mountainous route from the Shivalik Range foothills at Kalka (Haryana) to Shimla, the train ride offers spectacular views of the surrounding hills and villages. On the way, it stops at a number of tourist destinations, like Solan, Dharampur, Summer Hill, Salogra, Taradevi, and Barog, among others. The ride will take you through no less than 864 bridges, 919 curves, and 102 tunnels. The train ride in itself may not count as a ‘place’ to visit in the region, but missing the ride means missing out on some of the splendid sights that Shimla has to offer.</p>
    <h2>Kufri, Shimla</h2>
    <img src="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1000x650-324.jpg">
    <p>A ride of about 40 minutes from the city center will bring you to Kufri, another must-visit place in the region. Located at an elevation of 8607 ft., this small hill station promises you panoramic views of the surrounding snow-capped mountains. But Kufri is not just about Shimla sightseeing. It is also an adventure hub that offers training and facilities for exciting winter sports like ice skating and skiing. That is why it is also known as the winter sports capital of India. Since Kufri experiences regular snowfall in winter, it ranks top among the places to visit in Shimla in December.</p>
    <h2>Himachal State Museum, Shimla</h2>

    <p>Located on the Mall Road, the Himachal State Museum (also known as Shimla State Museum) is housed in a colonial mansion. It has a rich collection of miniature paintings, stone sculptures, coins, weapons, armors, dolls, jewelry, handicrafts, and numismatic articles discovered in the valley. All of the articles preserved here serve as remnants of the grand cultural heritage of the state. An assortment of bronze idols collected from various temples spread across the Himalayas is of particular attraction at this place. If you are a history buff, you will find the place a treasure trove of heritage and information.

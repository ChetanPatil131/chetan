    <h1>JAIPUR TOURISM</h1>
    <h2>HAWA MAHAL</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hawa-mahal1.jpg">
    <p>Built by Sawai Pratap Singh in 1799, Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Winds is the most iconic landmark or Jaipur. Indeed, Hawa Mahal symbolizes Jaipur in a way that Gateway of India symbolizes Mumbai and Shaniwar Wada symbolizes Pune. Built as a high screen for the women of the royal household, Hawa Mahal is made from red and pink sandstone and stands right at the edge of the City Palace and extends to the women’s chambers or zenana.

        Hawa Mahal has been designed to look like the crown of Krishna and stands tall at five stories, its façade resembling a honeycomb. With 953 intricately latticework jharokhas or small windows, Hawa Mahal served as a perfect cover for the Rajput women to watch the everyday goings-on and the special processions on the streets below. Jhunjhunu’s Khetri Mahal served as the inspiration for this spectacular structure after Pratap Singh was intimidated and inspired by it. In the centuries that followed, it was Hawa Mahal that shot into prominence and became the icon of a city that attracted people from all over the world. DON’T MISS
        
        While the intricate latticework is spectacular to look at, it also served a paractical purpose. The lattice permitted the royal ladies to watch life pass by in the streets below without being seen in return and thus maintaining their purdah. The latticework also serves another purpose by allowing only the cool breeze to pass through thus working as a natural air conditioner of sorts even in peak summers. Because of its strategic positioning, Hawa Mahal was offers breathtaking views of Jantar Mantar, City Palace and the Siredeori Bazaar.
        
        Hawa Mahal timings: 9am to 5pm
        
        Approximate visit duration: Two hours</p>
        <h2>CITY PALACE</h2>
        <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/city-palace-jaipur.jpg">
        <p>Right next to Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s City Palace that predates the latticework masterpiece by a few decades. Construction on the City Palace was completed in 1732 and it served as the seat of power for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Even to this day, a part of the City Palace is out of bounds for general public because it continues to serve as home to the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur. The city Palace complex is home to Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal and its various iconic gates — Udai Pol, Tripolia Gate and Virendra Pol among others — blend the Rajput style of architecture with that of Mughals and European, the two powers that the Kucchwaha Rajputs allied themselves with during their time in power.

            Jaipur’s City Palace was commissioned by Jai Singh II who moved the capital down from Amber Fort to the plains since there wasn’t enough water for his burgeoning population. The city of Jaipur was planned in six blocks that were separated by broad avenues. Jai Singh II ruled over his people from the City Palace even as he oversaw the construction of Jantar Mantar, which was completed two years after the City Palace.
            
            City Palace also has a museum that displays a wide array of royal costumes, some very exquisite and precious Pashmina shawls, Benaras silk saris, Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery as well as weaponry used by the Rajputs and other knick-knacks that provide a glimpse into the life and times of the various Sawais.
            
            City Palace timings: 9am to 5pm
            
            Approximate visit duration: Two hours</p>
        <h2>JANTAR MANTAR</h2>
        <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jantar-mantar-jaipur1.jpg">
        <p>Jantar Mantar of Jaipur is one of the five observatories constructed by Jai Singh II. Ujjain, Delhi and Varanasi are the other cities that house the remaining Jantar Mantars but there remain no traces of the one at Mathura. Among the many instruments that are part of this observatory is the world’s biggest sundial. Jantar Mantar is located just a stone’s throw from City Palace and Hawa Mahal and features instruments made of stone and brass that were built using instrument design principles from ancient texts. In all there are 19 instruments that help observe astronomical positions with the naked eye. Jantar Mantar is a fine example of Ptolemaic positional astronomy and has instruments that operate in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the ecliptic system, the horizon-zenith local system and the equatorial system. When it suffered some damage in the 19th century, Major Arthur Garrett, an amateur astronomer who was posted as the Assistant State Engineer in Jaipur, undertook the first major restoration work on Jantar Mantar. As of 2010, Jantar Mantar has been included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites and remains a gem of Jaipur that cannot be missed.

            Jantar Mantar timings: 9am to 5pm
            
            Approximate visit duration: One to two hours</p>
        <h2>ALBERT HALL MUSEUM</h2>
        <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/albert-hall-museum-jaipur.jpg">
        <p>One of the oldest museums in Rajasthan, Albert Hall Museum is located amidst the sprawling Ram Niwas Gardens just on the outskirts of the traditional market area of Jaipur. Albert Hall Museum doesn’t just house a collection of rare paintings but also showcases some exquisite pieces of jewelry, chiseled brass-ware, pottery and natural stones, ivory goods, metal sculptures and crystal works.

            Designed by Sir Swinton Jacob, the building of Albert Hall Museum is an example of Indo- Saracenic architecture and its foundation was laid by Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward) during his visit to India in 1876. While it was being built, there were various suggestions about how to put the building to the best use. Needless to say, the building was considered as a venue for a town hall or as a venue for a school or an education institution. But Madho Singh approved the idea of turning it into a museum in 1880. Construction on the building was completed in 1887. Albert Hall Museum has a somewhat eclectic collection of things on display — from dioramas to tribal costumes, miniature paintings to carpets and, for good measure, even an Egyptian mummy!
            
            Among its admirers was the author Rudyard Kipling who was so impressed, not just by the building but also its curated contents, that he wrote that it was ‘a rebuke to all other museums in India from Calcutta downwards. ‘
            
            Albert Hall Museum timings: 9am to 5pm
            
            Approximate visit duration: One hour</p>
        <h2>RAMBAGH PALACE</h2>
        <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rambagh-palace.jpg">
        <p>Rambagh Palace is often called the Jewel of Jaipur and it doesn’t take a lot to see why it has earned this sobriquet. One of the most beautiful palaces in India, Rambagh once served as the residence to the Maharaja of Jaipur. While the palace has been converted into a very fine hotel, the family continues to receive preference even to this day. By all estimates, Rambagh is the most expensive hotel in Jaipur.

            Interestingly, Rambagh was originally built as a garden house in 1835 for Kesar Badaran, the wet nurse of Ram Singh II. Under the reign of Madho Singh, this garden house and its surroundings received an upgrade and the house was converted into a royal hunting lodge since at the time it was surrounded by thick forest. This task — of converting a garden house into a hunting lodge — was given to Sir Swinton Jacob, the same man who designed the Albert Hall Museum. Eventually marble halls, corridors and courtyards were added to the garden site and Man Singh II made Rambagh Palace his main residence in 1931. The palace was also home to Maharani Gayatri Devi and has hosted several dignitaries from India and around the world. Among those who have stayed here are Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, Jacqueline Kennedy, the former First Lady of the United States and, of course, Prince Charles of England.

            Today, Rambagh Palace has 78 rooms and four suites, a restaurant, a coffee shop and a bar as well as conference rooms, swimming pools and a spa. Suvarna Mahal, located in the former palace ballroom, serves Indian cuisine, Rajput Room and Verandah Cafe offer multi-cuisine options while Steam, the lounge bar offers some great Mediterranean delights. Rambagh’s watering hole is called Polo Bar, which with its trophies and memorabilia of the Jaipur polo team on display, makes for a great place to wind down after a long day. Rambagh Palace showcases the best of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture and since it is run by the Taj Group, it remains one of the few well-maintained buildings of its time.
            
            Rambagh Palace is not open for public viewing. To see it from the inside, you will either need to book a stay here or get a table at one of the restaurants. Since it is a five-star hotel, the prices are obviously steep but there are few things that come close to walking down the haloed corridors of this spectacular structure. If, however, you do book a stay at Rambagh, ask the duty manager (0141 6671234) for a heritage tour of the palace. The tour lasts about 45 minutes.</p>

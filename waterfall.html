    <p>Jog Falls Tourism
        The second-highest plunge waterfall in India, Jog Falls is a major tourist attraction in Karnataka and is the highest waterfall in the state. Second, to the Nohkalikai Falls of Meghalaya, Jog falls drops about a huge 253 m (850 ft. ) in a single fall. However, due to the construction of Linganamakki Dam which is a hydroelectricity plant closeby, the flow in the falls is hugely restricted before monsoons. So, it is best to go during the Monsoon season to see the falls in its full form.
        
        Jog Falls is a 2 hours drive from the main Shimoga city. Also known as Gerosappa Falls or the Joga Falls, this seasonal waterfall is broken into four segments - Raja, Roarer, Rocket and Rani. They're named based on certain characteristics of the streams. Raja is an unbroken stream, Roarer is a strong and violent current that gushes down to meet the Raja stream, Rocket flows down in different jets and Rani is a quiet stream with falls in foam. Next time you visit, try identifying the streams!</p>
        <h2>Dudhsagar Falls</h2>

        <p>Dudhsagar Falls, Goa Overview
            One of India's tallest waterfalls, the Dudhsagar Falls is located inside the Mollem National Park. The majestic falls are a little farther inland approximately 60 km from Panaji on the Goa - Karnataka Border. Literally translating to Sea of Milk , the 310 m high waterfall is divided into four tiers on the Mandovi river and resemble a heavy rush of milk flowing effortlessly down the hill.
            
            While most people arrive at the Dudhsagar falls by jeep or by their own private transport from Panaji and nearby areas, others choose to visit the falls through a train journey or by trekking. The famous Dudhsagar Railway trek is closed to the public but the trek to the lower falls is still open.
            
            The Dudhsagar falls should be visited during the monsoon when it is in full flow and the surrounding deciduous forests are at their verdant best. However, reaching the falls during monsoon if difficult and it is closed if the water level gets too high.</p>
        <h2>Dhuandhar Falls</h2>
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/cmsuploads/compressed/Dhuandhar_Waterfall_on_the_River_Narmada_20170424203308.jpg">
        <p>Dhuandhar Falls, Jabalpur Overview
            Dhuandhar falls are located in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Pradesh. The beautiful falls cascade down for 30 m and are also one of the most visited tourist attractions in Jabalpur. The river Narmada flows through the famous marble-like falls, narrows down and plunges into a waterfall so forcefully that it creates a bouncing mass of mist and results into the Dhuandhar falls. The plunges are so powerful that its uproar can be heard from a far-off distance.
            
            Viewing platforms have been constructed along the side to facilitate proper views. Make sure that you do not cross these railings. There lies a bed of white and grey marble rocks below the water that further enhances the whitish colour of the waterfall. The view is spectacular and the surroundings are always chock-full with tourists wanting to get a glimpse of the falls.</p>
        <h2>Athirapally Falls</h2>
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/compressed/attractions/attr_1466.jpg">
        <p>Athirapally Falls, Thrissur Overview
            Located 60 km from the Thrissur district of Kerala, Athirapally Falls is a marvellous cascade of frothy waters that makes its way from the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats. Also called as Bahubali Waterfall, this 80 ft high and 330 ft wide marvel is the largest waterfall in Kerala. It is often referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India". From here, the Athirapally falls flows through the verdant greenery of Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea, creating a spectacular vista of scintillating water, emerald jungles and azure sky.
            
            When you land in Athirapally, you are greeted with the sight of charming green Sholayar Peaks peering over the rushing gush of the falls. Standing against the backdrop of a rustling jungle foliage, this many films and music videos are shot here. Bird lovers cannot miss this place, for it is the only place in the Western Ghats where four endangered Hornbill species are seen. There is a pool above the falls where you can relax and unwind. To get a view of the waterfall, one needs to get down from the mountain for about 100 meters.
            
            Another interesting fact to note is that the fall joins forces with the Chalakkudy river before reaching its final destination into the sea. There are a couple of water theme parks on the way to Athirappilly called Silver Storm and Dream World and many resorts as well.</p>

        <p>A quick nature getaway from major cities of Maharashtra like Mumbai and Thane, Pandavkada Waterfall is famous for the scenic landscape it is part of. A number of people get out of their concrete dwellings over the weekends to feel a touch of mother nature and soak in the natural splendour of Pandavkada Waterfall.

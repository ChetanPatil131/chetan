    <p>Charminar, Hyderabad Overview
        An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.
        
        Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, along with Qutub Shahi Tombs and the Golconda Fort, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>

        <p>Hussain Sagar Lake, Hyderabad Overview
            Renowned as Asia's largest artificial lake, Hussain Sagar Lake is one of the most popular tourist attractions located in Hyderabad. The lake itself was commissioned by Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah in 1563 and is renowned for its monolith of Lord Buddha that stands right in its centre. Incidentally, this monolith structure is the tallest of its kind in the world! Hussain Sagar lake is also Called Tank Bund and lies on a tributary of River Musi. The attraction also has 3 km long dam wall and connects the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. It is bordered by Indira Park, Sanjeevaiah Park, and Lumbini Park on 3 sides and is truly a relaxing and calming getaway from the city.
            
            Although the Hussain Sagar Lake is popular for activities such as fish culture, water sports and boat rides, the major attraction of the lake is a monolithic Buddha statue situated right at the heart of the lake. The statue of Buddha was installed in the year 1992 and was inaugurated by His Holiness Dalai Lama himself. Standing at the Tank Bund, you can see the whole lake shimmering around you as the lights sparkle on the shore. Thus, the road is also known as the 'Necklace Road'. Owing to its unique heart-shaped outline, the Hussain Sagar Lake has been declared as the 'Heart of the World' by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).</p>

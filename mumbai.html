The island city that Mumbai is today is owing to these reclamation and these islands were home to several fishing colonies. The British made Mumbai an important port since it was already had a natural harbor but it rose to its richness during the American Civil War when cotton supplies were completely stopped from America to Britain.

    <h2>Gateway of India</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mumbai-Gateway-625x470.jpg">
    <p>The Gateway of India that was built in the 20th century is one of the biggest tourist attractions of Mumbai. The building stands beautifully overlooking the Arabian Sea and the location of this building is what makes it so attractive. It is 85 feet tall and it is one of Mumbai’s most significant landmarks. The construction of the Gateway of India took almost 13 years to finish and it was built in dedication to the first visit done by King George V and also Queen Mary to India. This happened in 1911 and hence if you have never noticed, there is also a line that reads, ‘Erected to commemorate the landing in India of their Imperial Majesties King George V and Queen Mary on the second December MCMXI.’ Right opposite to this attraction stands another beautiful and historical building- the Taj Mahal Hotel. This hotel has existed even before the Gateway of India was erected, 21 years before to be precise. Opposite to this beautiful landmark of Mumbai also stands a statue of Shivaji that has a historical significance. Shivaji was a king who resorted to guerilla warfare so that his Maratha Empire could be established. He wanted to set up his empire in the Sahyadri mountain range so that it stands as a symbol of pride and courage that the empire strongly reflected in those times. The statue of Shivaji was unveiled on Republic day in 1961. The Gateway also has total of five jetties to take you to other places of interest away from Mumbai like the Elephanta caves and also Alibaug. Visit the Gateway of India for the scenic beauty. The views of the sea from this monument are worth watching and truly a sight to behold. The architecture is a mix of both Hindu and Muslim styles. The arch of the monument has been given a Muslim styled architecture and the decorating part has been done using Hindu style. </p>
    <h2>Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus</h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chhatrapati-Shivaji-Terminus-625x470.jpg">
    <p>Another great attraction is the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus that is visited by millions of people. This terminus was also built during the British rule and the construction of the same started in 1787 that went on till 1887. In 1887 it was finally put open for public use. Mumbaikars call this station CST. Before this terminus got its name of Shivaji, it was named Victoria Terminus and was called VT. There are many people who still refer to CST as VT. The architecture of this terminus is highly inspired by Victorian Gothic styles and it is one of the first to be set up in Mumbai. It is inevitable that people who visit Mumbai from faraway places don’t visit this place. Since it serves as a major transport source for Mumbaikars, the CST is really significant. There are a total of 18 platforms and among these seven are only for local uses. Local trains in Mumbai that connect harbor, western and central railways and the 11 platforms are for trains that go outside Mumbai. For travelers’ comfort, they also have an in house dormitory that can be used by people only if pre booked. This historical building has seen it’s mentioning in many movies that also includes Slumdog Millionaire that was an award winning movie. And being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is lifeline of Mumbai and hence is also considered to be one of the most significant monuments of this city and also the nation. Not many know that CST also organizes a tour that will let you go through the many features of this brilliant structure. These are features that you may not notice otherwise. The CST has also been victim to an unfortunate even when terrorists attacked some in 2008. The terrorist attacks have gone down in Indian history to be one of its kinds and the terminus that was flooded with people got killed. Though, even after this, CST has sprung back to life and carries people to and fro just like it used to. This spirit of people is what makes Mumbai so charming.</p>

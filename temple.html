   <p>One of the most holy sites for Hindu pilgrims, Vaishno Devi Temple is nestled on the Trikuta mountain in Jammu & Kashmir. As per the legend, Vaishno Devi under the disguise of a young girl, Vaishnavi was being chased by a black magician, Bhairo Nath.

    He was pestering her to marry him. In order to escape him, she fled to the mountains but he followed her there too. After stopping at present day Banganga, Charan Paduka and Adkwari, the Goddess finally reached the holy shrine. When Bhairo Nath showed no sign of backing down, Vaishnavi was compelled to kill him.
    
    She beheaded him at the mouth of the cave and his head fell at a distant hill top. After realizing his mistake, Bhairo Nath begged for her forgiveness. Taking pity on him, the Goddess blessed him with a boon that anyone who takes up the pilgrimage to the shrine will also have to visit Bhairo Nath Temple, only then will the journey be completed.

    <p>Bangalore Palace, Bangalore Overview
        An epitome of great architecture and beauty, The Majestic Bangalore Palace preserves in it the spice of old regal opulence. Currently the central attraction in Bangalore, the palace was built in the year 1878. Chamarajendra Wadiyar's British Guardians bought the original property in 1873 from the principal of Bangalore Central High School, Rev, J Garret, from his funds. The palace is extraordinarily vast and spread across 45,000 square feet. A mixture of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architecture have resulted into the grand palace that we see today. The wooden structure of the palace along with the beautiful carvings both inside and outside showcases the royal culture in different ways.
        
        Apart from being a major tourist destination, the palace is a host to different cultural events, rock shows, and marriages. As per beliefs, King Chamarajendra Wadiyar drew his inspiration for building the palace from the Windsor Castle of London. The granite seats decorated with fluorescent blue ceramic tiles on the ground floor, a fairy tale Ballroom, the famous painter Raja Ravi Varma's paintings, vine-covered walls, and the Durbar Hall on the first floor come together to form the prepossessing Bangalore Palace. 
        A visit to the palace gives you a chance to witness the elegant and lavish splendour of one of the most powerful dynasties of South India. An audio tape is available inside the Palace, both in Hindi and English, to help the people having language issues, understand its history better.

Reddy laid down the first brick of this establishment on 13 July 1951 and initiated the construction of a monument that symbolizes the legislative sovereignty of the people of the country. Its construction took a good five years and it was finally inaugurated in 1956 to become the largest legislative building in India. The Vidhana Soudha stands 150 feet tall and boasts of an elegant and truly exquisite Neo-Dravidian style of architecture.

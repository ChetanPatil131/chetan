    <p>The capital city of Jammu and Kashmir, Srinagar is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places to visit in Kashmir. Nestled on the picturesque banks of the Jhelum river, Srinagar is known fondly as the “Heaven on Earth”. The biggest city of Kashmir, Srinagar is known famously for its colorful Shikaras and houseboats floating on the postcard-perfect Dal Lake. Srinagar has also gained a lot of fame across the globe for its dreamy Mughal gardens, namely Nishat Bagh, Shalimar Bagh and Chashm-E-Shahi Garden.</p>

    <p>Nicknamed as the ‘Meadow of Flowers’, Gulmarg is one of the most romantic places to visit in Kashmir. Gulmarg lets you soak in the picturesque views of colourful flowers spread against majestic snow-cladaccessed off the dead-end road that links the 1965 neo-colonial style Hotel Highlands Park to the historic Gulmarg Golf Club. However, the key reason to visit Gulmarg is just not the same.

The valley is the connecting point of a number of Himalayan peaks like Kolhoi peak, Amarnath peak, Sirbal Peak, and so on. The charming view of the place becomes more attractive with the wide varieties of flowers and alpine trees gracing this quaint town.

        Here you can enjoy, meadows of gold, sun-kissed peaks, breathtaking lakes and towering glaciers, all in one place. This beautiful himalayan town is full of mountain ranges and valleys to explore through trekking. It is a base camp for trekkers going to Ladakh and for many trekking routes to different lakes of Kashmir, such as Krishnasar Lake, Gadsar Lake, Vishansar Lake, and so on. During winter the valley covered with snow offers an opportunity to the tourist to enjoy sledding or skiing or snow fighting.</p>

    <p>In the year 1983, this little Kashmiri Valley formed the backdrop of the hit Bollywood flick Betaab. Since then, the former Hagan Valley has earned its name ‘Betaab’ Valley. With its backdrop dotted with coniferous forests, gushing streams and meadows, the beauty of Betaab beckons to all those looking to escape into the serenity of the natural world.

    <p>The beautifully laid Shalimar Bagh happens to be the largest amongst the three iconic Mughal gardens in Srinagar. The Shalimar Garden was constructed back in 1619 under the orders of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, who dedicated it to his wife Nur Jahan. Nicknamed as the “Crown of Srinagar”, this public park is set overlooking the shimmering waters of the picturesque Dal Lake.

        The very term ‘Shalimar’ translates to ‘Abode of Love’ in Sanskrit and is also referred to as Farah Baksh and Faiz Baksh. The exquisite Shalimar Garden offers an amazing amalgamation of stunning man-made structures, brilliant architecture, natural allure, and well-manicured gardens.
